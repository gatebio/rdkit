def ClusterData(data, nPts, distThresh, isDistData=False, distFunc=EuclideanDist, reordering=False):
  """  clusters the data points passed in and returns the list of clusters

    **Arguments**

      - data: a list of items with the input data
        (see discussion of _isDistData_ argument for the exception)

      - nPts: the number of points to be used

      - distThresh: elements within this range of each other are considered
        to be neighbors

      - isDistData: set this toggle when the data passed in is a
          distance matrix.  The distance matrix should be stored
          symmetrically. An example of how to do this:

            dists = []
            for i in range(nPts):
              for j in range(i):
                dists.append( distfunc(i,j) )

      - distFunc: a function to calculate distances between points.
           Receives 2 points as arguments, should return a float

      - reordering: if this toggle is set, the number of neighbors is updated
           for the unassigned molecules after a new cluster is created such
           that always the molecule with the largest number of unassigned
           neighbors is selected as the next cluster center.

    **Returns**

      - a tuple of tuples containing information about the clusters:
         ( (cluster1_elem1, cluster1_elem2, ...),
           (cluster2_elem1, cluster2_elem2, ...),
           ...
         )
         The first element for each cluster is its centroid.
